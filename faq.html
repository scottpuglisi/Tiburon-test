    Keypads may seem like a great addition at first, but upon closer examination you can see the drawbacks.
    <br><br><br>
    Tiburon's locker philosophy is to give you the correct ratio of payment points to lockers.
    This is because your guests spend exponentially more time interacting with a kiosk when renting a locker, not when accessing it.
    Having less payment points only saves companies from having to spend more on them.
    Keypads shouldn’t be a substitution for payment points.
    <br><br><br>
    Keypads also create another point of failure and are unprotected in many other ways.
    They're not waterproof, so liquids can leak in through the unsealed number buttons and cause damage.
    These unsealed crevices are also subject to harbor excessive grime, rust, mold, and bacteria.
    Physical, electronic keypads are difficult to disinfect without causing damage and would be nearly impossible to keep clean at larger venues.
    <br><br><br>
    It's much easier, cleaner, and safe to have a self cleaning kiosk, antimicicrobial paint, and lockers without handles - <a class="blue-link" href="ele-lockers.html/#new-features">all from Tiburon Lockers!</a>

    In our nearly two decades of operations, the answer has been no.
    As partners, it's our goal to save your money in the short term, make you more long term, and provide the highest level of service and support.
    Most locker companies want to sell the product and want nothing to do with service.
    <br><br><br>
    However, we do listen, and we've heard the demand. Businesses want a Tiburon-quality electronic locker available for purchase.

There are many different ways that we're able to earn more revenue.
<br><br><br>
Anytime you’re sharing your revenue, transparency and ethics are critical.
Tiburon commits to a percentage and pays the agreed percentage.  
<br><br><br>
Many of our opportunities come from venues that were offered a higher percentage and later realized that the actual money they are being paid isn’t what it should be.  
<br><br><br>
Tiburon uses its historical data to create a smart, custom pricing system that correctly prices every size of locker at your business.
Using this data, we've created multiple pricing options to fit any type of venue.
<br><br><br>
Tiburon's superior service also helps earn you more revenue.
Because we are your locker partners, it's in our best interest to fix the lockers if anything were to occur.
If they're not working we don't earn anything either.
<br><br><br>
When a part of our system goes down, we'll fix it for you - <strong>that's the Tiburon guarantee!</strong>

Most of locations are serviced by our full-time staff who our dispatched from our operations office.
At some of our busiest venues we have paid staff to assist guests with the lockers and do maintenance full time.

Obviously buying lockers is an option, but the truth is like anything - to do it better, you need expertise and passion.
The largest deterrent, especially for electronic lockers, is huge initial investment you'll have to make.
It's not a guarantee you'll make that investment back, either.
<br><br><br>
After that you'll have to pay workers to install the lockers and figure out how they work.
You're then obligated to fully maintain the lockers and kiosk, which is complicated and again takes up countless employee hours.
<br><br><br>
Tiburon is extremely passionate about making your guest experiences all about your venue.
We are a small part of your operation, but one that if isn’t done well will negatively impact your guests.
<br><br><br>
<strong>In fact, we are proud to not only provide a better user experience, but we are also the right option if you are mostly concerned about the profitability of your lockers.</strong>

We are sorry to hear that you had a poor experience with one of our competitors.
Tiburon gets a lot of calls from regretful business owners after they've signed a contract with a huge percentage and don’t get any of the service or support they require, leading to less revenue than expected.
Their lockers break and they have no way to fix them, negatively impacting their business, revenue, and overall guest experience.
<br><br><br>
The contrast of professionalism between Tiburon Lockers and other companies becomes very apparent after switching.
Some of our strongest partnerships have came out of situations where businesses are discouraged from bad experiences with other locker companies.
Tiburon has the unique ability to turn an unsuccessful locker program around, and we always welcome the opportunity to pick up where other companies have failed.
<br><br><br>
Tiburon has become a leader in the locker industry by paying attention to the details that other companies have long forgotten.
In our lab, our engineers and programmers are constantly putting our lockers and kiosks through rigorous test scenarios to ensure there are no issues in any regard.
In the rare event that there is an issue, we are available for immediate resolution and always have our locker professionals ready to go.
<br><br><br>
One of the most important traits Tiburon will bring your business is consistency.
Lockers, like most things, will eventually break or malfunction - you need a way to fix them.
<br><br><br>
<strong>At Tiburon Lockers, we promise that we will stick to our word and guarantee to always be there for you.</strong>
