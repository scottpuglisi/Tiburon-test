    &quot;My Company, Desarrolladora Homex S.A.B. De C.V. (NYSE: HXM) is the largest builder of homes in Mexico. As such, we have many visitors each day in our headquarters in Culiacan, Sinaloa, Mexico. We looked to Tiburon Lockers to provide an electronic locker system that would provide visitors with a safe and convenient way to store their belongings while visiting our high security building. Tiburon provided an electronic system for us that has far exceeded our expectations and is in keeping with Homex's image as a technological industry leader. They did this at no cost to us and customized the solution for our needs without any hassle on our part. I highly recommend Tiburon's product and their customer service and would have no hesitation in recommending partnering with them.&quot;<p class="testimonial_sub">- Gerardo de Nicolas, Chief Executive Officer, Desarrolladora Homex S.A.B.

    &quot;Thanks to Tiburon for helping us provide another service to our valuable ice rink customers here at Centennial Olympic Park in Atlanta, Georgia.  Our partnership with Tiburon Lockers has been seamless and painless from contract to install to dismantle.  We were looking to provide an additional level of property security at the rink while our patrons enjoyed their skating experience.  We contacted Tiburon and the partnership worked to perfection.  We have just completed our first season and I believe all involved couldn't be more pleased.&quot;<p class="testimonial_sub">- Rick Glueckert, Owner, Ice Guys, LLC

    <h1>Feedback from our end users</h1>
    <p class="testimonial">&quot;Your lockers look great and seem easy to use.  I think it would be beneficial for your company to contact Westfield Malls across the country as I am a shopper and really do not like carrying my packages around the mall.  I would stay longer if I had a place to store my shopping bags.&quot;<p class="testimonial_sub">- Krista Haitz</p></p><br />
